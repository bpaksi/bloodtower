# Screen spec: C4 / 06-tomb-crawl — The Tomb: The Barrow's rooms, traps, listening and the hidden guardian

- Brief: ./plan.md
- Evals: ./evals.md
- Cards: MEC-026, DEC-486 to DEC-497, DEC-583 to DEC-592, DEC-602, DEC-617, DEC-618, DEC-651, DEC-652

## Rules for every screen

- Viewports: Story board 1920×1080 (Samsung TV); iPad 768×1024, portrait, locked by Bob.
- iPad bottom toolbar on every iPad screen: **?** (help) at the left, the **gear** at the right. Help text is `[COPY: help, <screen>]`.
- Gear panels display on the Story board; their picks are made on the iPad. The gear never opens a panel on the iPad alone.
- No Next-only screens: every iPad screen carries a real choice, or the board advances on its own after its beat. A lone "Next" button is a failed build.
- The board is display only and never scrolls or clips (SCR-013); every story line shows on the board (SCR-014, DEC-057). One primary button per step (SCR-016).
- All story and help text is `[COPY: ...]` until the story pass.

## Purpose

No new screen: engine work, proved by unit evals and the headless simulator. Any text it emits is a `[COPY: ...]` key that a C4 screen feature shows. The rules below bind the screens that display its state.

## OPEN questions

- OPEN Q-C4-07: The Barrow's guardian (the dead garrison, DEC-662): what level? Options: (a) level 3, as `tomb.guardian_level` in base tuning; (b) level 4. Gamewright pick: (a) (Gamewright pick, pending Bob).
- OPEN Q-C4-08: How many rooms does a 1.0 Tomb deal (DEC-491)? Options: (a) 7 rooms, guardian hidden in one of the last 3; (b) 5 rooms; (c) 9 rooms. Gamewright pick: (a) (Gamewright pick, pending Bob).
- OPEN Q-C4-09: Listening at a corridor (DEC-586): how often does the hint lie? Options: (a) 1 in 4 (`tomb.listen_lie` = 0.25); (b) 1 in 3. Gamewright pick: (a) (Gamewright pick, pending Bob).
